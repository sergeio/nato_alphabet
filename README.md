Nato Alphabet
=============

Print the NATO alphabet word corresponding to the letter


Why?
----

It's a good way to learn the words.


Usage
-----

Go through the alphabet forwards, and try to remember what NATO word matches
each letter.  Then you can try stepping through the alphabet backwards, and
maybe spelling various words (try my
[shakespeare_text](http://github.com/sergeio/shakespeare_text) project for
maximum fun).

If you can't remember a letter (for example, the letter 'u'), use the script:
```bash
$ nato u
Uniform
```

When first starting out, you can use the `-a` option to see the whole alphabet.
```bash
$ nato -a
